// HealthStatus defines the structure of the JSON response returned by the
// application's health check endpoint (/v1/healthcheck).
//
// It provides metadata about the application's current operational status,
// including availability, deployment context, versioning, and runtime readiness.
// This structure is used to inform load balancers, orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes),
// monitoring systems, and operators about the application's health and deployability.
//
// Fields:
//   - Status: A high-level indicator of service availability (e.g., "available").
//   - Environment: The current environment in which the app is running (e.g., "development", "staging","production").
//   - Version: The application version string, useful for deployment tracking.
//   - Servers: The number of OBA (OneBusAway) backend servers currently configured and used.
//   - Ready: A boolean flag indicating whether the application is ready to serve traffic.
//     The application is considered "ready" if at least one backend server is configured.
//
// This struct is constructed and serialized to JSON by the `healthcheckHandler`,
// and it plays a central role in operational observability and readiness checks.
